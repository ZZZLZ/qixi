When that day comes, all my fantasies will come true:
Holding your hand along the coastline, walking down the setting sun;
On the farthest mountain, the dawn of your first sunrise is on your shoulder;
When I was born that the statue of hands praying;
In the snow falling silent, ten interlocking to kiss your face.
XJJ,I LOVE U!
